## FEBRUARY 7 – 8, 2015
### NEW ORLEANS ERNEST N. MORIAL CONVENTION CENTER

In August, New Orleans and the Gulf Coast will commemorate the 10th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. Since then, the world has seen an explosion in the development and adoption of mobile technology and new tools, enabling us to now experience disasters first-hand. Through the eyes and ears of those on the ground, we’ve all lived through each hurricane, earthquake, tsunami, wildfire, school shooting, protest and revolution. We’ve felt the fear, the loss, and the hope of those on the ground, through text, photo, and video. Armed with this information, with each disaster, communities have become more and more part of the response. Technology now connects those in need with those who want to help – a global community of neighbors, despite geographic location. Had technology been as advanced as it is today, imagine what we could have done in the days and weeks following Hurricane Katrina.

**"Due to the hurricane, your call cannot be completed at this time. Please try again later"**

To kick off the tenth anniversary year of Hurricane Katrina, The [International Disaster Conference & EXPO (IDCE)](http://internationaldisasterconference.com/disastertech-hackathon)!, in partnership with [CODEMKRS](https://codemkrs.com/)!, a locally-owned company that has produced hackathons for South by Southwest Music Festival, Super Bowl XLIII, and the White House’s National Day of Civic Hacking, will host the first annual #DisasterTech hackathon February 7-8, 2015 at the New Orleans Ernest N. Morial Convention Center. A hackathon is an event where computer programmers, technology developers, designers and other creative thinkers collaborate in a contained environment to solve problems through technology in new and innovative ways. Leveraging lessons learned since Hurricane Katrina, the IDCE #DisasterTech Hackathon seeks to foster the convergence of the disaster and tech communities, driving innovation and opportunity for collaboration by encouraging the development of advanced and long-term solutions in the public safety and disaster space.
