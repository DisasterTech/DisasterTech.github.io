## February 7 – 8, 2015
### New Orleans Ernest N Morial Convention Center

To kick off the tenth anniversary year of Hurricane Katrina, The [International Disaster Conference & EXPO (IDCE)](http://internationaldisasterconference.com/disastertech-hackathon)!, in partnership with [CODEMKRS](https://codemkrs.com/)!, a locally-owned company that has produced hackathons for South by Southwest Music Festival, Super Bowl XLIII, and the White House’s National Day of Civic Hacking, will host the first annual #DisasterTech hackathon February 7-8, 2015 at the New Orleans Ernest N. Morial Convention Center. A hackathon is an event where computer programmers, technology developers, designers and other creative thinkers collaborate in a contained environment to solve problems through technology in new and innovative ways. Leveraging lessons learned since Hurricane Katrina, the IDCE #DisasterTech Hackathon seeks to foster the convergence of the disaster and tech communities, driving innovation and opportunity for collaboration by encouraging the development of advanced and long-term solutions in the public safety and disaster space.
